I'm basing the structure of this repo (=*.edn= files, etc) off of [[https://github.com/tschady/advent-of-code/tree/main][tschady's repo]].

* Introduction

My Clojure solutions to the [[https://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] challenge (to be reused over multiple years).

* Structure

** Babashka scripts

Hand scripts (thanks tschady) are in =script=.

=bb.edn= defines tasks that call them.

e.g. To create stub files for 2023 day 7, download the data to =resources/day07.txt= and open the websites for the problem and data, run:

#+begin_example
  bb go -y 2023 -d 7
#+end_example

** Basic setup

Use =deps.edn= to define dependencies and paths.

Files in =src= and =resources= can be found during runtime.

Tests use file in =test=.

** Tests

Tests are under =tests=.

Tests use =kaocha= (not sure how this works yet).

=kaocha= recommends setting up test configs in =tests.edn=.
